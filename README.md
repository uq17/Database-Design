# Database-Design
This repository contains entity relationship diagrams of database models created using MySQL, SQL Workbench, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. For each ERD, business rules of users were carefully analyzed to create entities and entity relationships. These data models are meant to reflect the responsibilities of a database administrator managing an IT enterprise.
